			<h2>The Cessna Skywagon</h2>
			<p>The Cessna Skywagon was a name given to two different high wing tail dragger aircraft. The Cessna 180 was the first version of the Skywagon starting production in 1953. Later in 1961 the Cessna 185 was introduced as a heavy duty utility version of the Cessna 180. These aircraft are some of the most common airplanes that operate in the United States 49th state: Alaska.

			<p>N185GM also known as "Fireball" to users of the supercub forum is a <a href="http://www.supercub.org/forum/showthread.php?32357-Light-185-project">highly modified</a> 1962 Cessna 185. With an impressive paint job and equipment, <span class="fb"> "Fireball" </span> is an airplane that will not let you look away!
			<h3 class="ocd">N8204V "Oh Cee Dee"<a href="img/bigcd.png"><img src="img/smallcd.png" alt="N8204V"></a></h3>
			<p>N8204V nicknamed <span class="ocd"> "Oh Cee Dee" </span> by members of the <a href="https://www.backcountrypilot.org/forum/project-180-skywagon-the-on-going-saga-11296">Back Country Pilots</a> group was inspired by <span class="fb"> "Fireball" </span> when its owner visited the shop that built it. This turned into a build that encompased multiple years of work which made an aircraft of similar characteristic to <span class="fb"> "Fireball". </span>
			<h3><span class="tr">N9951X "Trusty Rusty"</span> and <span class="tr">"MyWagon"</span></h3>
			<p>N9951X nicknamed <span class="tr"> "Trusty Rusty" </span> by myself is my ongoing project. The work that is going to go into <span class="tr"> "Trusty Rusty" </span> is inspired by <span class="fb"> Fireball </span> and <span class="ocd"> "Oh Cee Dee" </span> when it is completed, it should be of similar appearance and performance to both modified Skywagons.
			<h3>Why the skywagon is so versitial</h3>
			<ul id="fontbad">
				<li>Light Airframe With Loads of Power
					<br>The Skywagons all had an empty weight of about 1,700lbs and a gross weight of 3,200lbs. 
					<br>With the 230 to 300 horse engine and wingtip mods the useful weight can be much higher than the empty weight.
				</li>
				<li>Tailwheel Design
					<br>With the conventional tailwheel design, the skywagon can get into dirt and other sorts of unimproved strips.
					<br>Having the wheel in the tail instead of the nose protects the firewall from damage on hard landings.
				</li>
